Create a function to calculate the area of a circle, given its radius. The radius can be any positive number. 

To calculate the area of a circle, you can use the formula: 

Area = π * r^2

Where π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle.

For example, if the radius of a circle is 5, then the area of the circle would be:

Area",0.8271724581718445,0.8159584403038025,0.011214017868041992,0.8122016787528992,0.0009228666312992573

Create a function to calculate the area of a circle, given its radius. The radius can be any positive number. 

To calculate the area of a circle, you can use the formula: 

Area = π * r^2

Where π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle.

For example, if the radius of a circle is 5, then the area of the circle would be",0.8455097675323486,0.8526853322982788,-0.007175564765930176,0.47336137294769287,0.000750758103094995

Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers from the input list. The function should be implemented using a for loop and should not use any built-in functions or libraries for prime number generation. Additionally, the function should also be able to handle negative numbers and floating-point numbers in the input list, converting them to their absolute values and integer formats before processing.
